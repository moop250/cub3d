## Description

cub3d is a project inspired by the legendary Wolfenstein 3D, aiming to introduce students to the basics of raycasting. The goal of the project is to create a simple 3D game from a 2D map using raycasting techniques, allowing a first-person perspective view.

## Base Features

- **Raycasting Engine:** Develops a basic raycasting engine to render a 3D view from a 2D map layout.
- **Textured Walls:** Provides textured rendering for walls to enhance visual experience.
- **User Input Handling:** Manages user inputs for movement and interaction within the environment.
- **Map Management:** Reads and validates maps to ensure they conform to specified requirements.

## Bonus Functionality

The bonus part of cub3d enhances the basic functionality with the following features:

- **Floor and Ceiling Texturing:** Adds more realism by texturing the floor and ceiling.
- **Sprite Rendering:** Integrates visible sprites, allowing for objects within the world.
- **Minimap:** Implements a minimap for easier navigation.
- **Lighting Effects:** Introduces basic lighting and shading for a more immersive experience.
